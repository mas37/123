Sample automated documentation with Sphinx 1.8.2

build/html/index.html 
build/latex/panna.pdf

using the PANNA src/neuralnet package
and
source/index.rst and source/neuralnet/*rst files

Change the sphinx source rst files
& 
make html / make latexpdf to generate updated 
documentation

Note: 
Sphinx imports each module file (each .py file) inside 
neuralnet package. 
If we use relative addresses for loading one module file
from another module file, it gets confused.
Use the full package name to prevent this such as 
"from neuralnet.layers import hidden_layer_gauss" 
And add the directory containing the package to 
the path in the source/conf.py, 
in addition to the package directory that holds the module files themselves.
